Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie\'s energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20\'s she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women\'s Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie\'s life will be held at a later date.

Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie's energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20's she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women's Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie's life will be held at a later date.

Mary had an indefatigable and vibrant zest for life and fought her illness to the very end, dying as she had always wished at home. Born in Winnetka, Il on April 1, 1929 the youngest of four children of Morton and Elizabeth Cahn, Mary attended North Shore Country Day and Rockford College and upon graduation moved to New York City in 1951. Early jobs at Scribner's and The New York Historical Society and a stint in Democratic Party politics gave way to a commitment to volunteerism on an extraordinary scale. Mary was at various times a founding member and first president of Playwrights' Horizons; president of the Mt. Sinai Auxiliary Board; and President of the West Side YWCA, an organization for which she went on to serve at a leadership level in both a national and global capacity, her travels on its behalf taking her around the world. A knowledgeable devotee of the arts, she was an enthusiastic subscriber of nearly every classical music institution and theater in town and, along with her late husband, Stephen, inculcated in her adoring son Matt a love of the arts that led to his career as a critic and journalist based in London.

Maggie was predeceased by her beloved husband of 45 years Richard I. and her adored sisters Constance H. Oliver O\'Neil and Audrey H. Hilliard. She is survived by her daughter Marguerite W. Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie\'s energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20\'s she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women\'s Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie\'s life will be held at a later date.

Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie\'s energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20\'s she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women\'s Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie\'s life will be held at a later date.

Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie's energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20's she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women's Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie's life will be held at a later date.

Mary had an indefatigable and vibrant zest for life and fought her illness to the very end, dying as she had always wished at home. Born in Winnetka, Il on April 1, 1929 the youngest of four children of Morton and Elizabeth Cahn, Mary attended North Shore Country Day and Rockford College and upon graduation moved to New York City in 1951. Early jobs at Scribner's and The New York Historical Society and a stint in Democratic Party politics gave way to a commitment to volunteerism on an extraordinary scale. Mary was at various times a founding member and first president of Playwrights' Horizons; president of the Mt. Sinai Auxiliary Board; and President of the West Side YWCA, an organization for which she went on to serve at a leadership level in both a national and global capacity, her travels on its behalf taking her around the world. A knowledgeable devotee of the arts, she was an enthusiastic subscriber of nearly every classical music institution and theater in town and, along with her late husband, Stephen, inculcated in her adoring son Matt a love of the arts that led to his career as a critic and journalist based in London.

Maggie was predeceased by her beloved husband of 45 years Richard I. and her adored sisters Constance H. Oliver O\'Neil and Audrey H. Hilliard. She is survived by her daughter Marguerite W. Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie\'s energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20\'s she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women\'s Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie\'s life will be held at a later date.

Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie\'s energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20\'s she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women\'s Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie\'s life will be held at a later date.

Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie's energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20's she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women's Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie's life will be held at a later date.

Mary had an indefatigable and vibrant zest for life and fought her illness to the very end, dying as she had always wished at home. Born in Winnetka, Il on April 1, 1929 the youngest of four children of Morton and Elizabeth Cahn, Mary attended North Shore Country Day and Rockford College and upon graduation moved to New York City in 1951. Early jobs at Scribner's and The New York Historical Society and a stint in Democratic Party politics gave way to a commitment to volunteerism on an extraordinary scale. Mary was at various times a founding member and first president of Playwrights' Horizons; president of the Mt. Sinai Auxiliary Board; and President of the West Side YWCA, an organization for which she went on to serve at a leadership level in both a national and global capacity, her travels on its behalf taking her around the world. A knowledgeable devotee of the arts, she was an enthusiastic subscriber of nearly every classical music institution and theater in town and, along with her late husband, Stephen, inculcated in her adoring son Matt a love of the arts that led to his career as a critic and journalist based in London.

Maggie was predeceased by her beloved husband of 45 years Richard I. and her adored sisters Constance H. Oliver O\'Neil and Audrey H. Hilliard. She is survived by her daughter Marguerite W. Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie\'s energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20\'s she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women\'s Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie\'s life will be held at a later date.

Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie\'s energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20\'s she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women\'s Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie\'s life will be held at a later date.

Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie's energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20's she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women's Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie's life will be held at a later date.

Mary had an indefatigable and vibrant zest for life and fought her illness to the very end, dying as she had always wished at home. Born in Winnetka, Il on April 1, 1929 the youngest of four children of Morton and Elizabeth Cahn, Mary attended North Shore Country Day and Rockford College and upon graduation moved to New York City in 1951. Early jobs at Scribner's and The New York Historical Society and a stint in Democratic Party politics gave way to a commitment to volunteerism on an extraordinary scale. Mary was at various times a founding member and first president of Playwrights' Horizons; president of the Mt. Sinai Auxiliary Board; and President of the West Side YWCA, an organization for which she went on to serve at a leadership level in both a national and global capacity, her travels on its behalf taking her around the world. A knowledgeable devotee of the arts, she was an enthusiastic subscriber of nearly every classical music institution and theater in town and, along with her late husband, Stephen, inculcated in her adoring son Matt a love of the arts that led to his career as a critic and journalist based in London.

Maggie was predeceased by her beloved husband of 45 years Richard I. and her adored sisters Constance H. Oliver O\'Neil and Audrey H. Hilliard. She is survived by her daughter Marguerite W. Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie\'s energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20\'s she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women\'s Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie\'s life will be held at a later date.

Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie\'s energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20\'s she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women\'s Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie\'s life will be held at a later date.

Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie's energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20's she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women's Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie's life will be held at a later date.

Mary had an indefatigable and vibrant zest for life and fought her illness to the very end, dying as she had always wished at home. Born in Winnetka, Il on April 1, 1929 the youngest of four children of Morton and Elizabeth Cahn, Mary attended North Shore Country Day and Rockford College and upon graduation moved to New York City in 1951. Early jobs at Scribner's and The New York Historical Society and a stint in Democratic Party politics gave way to a commitment to volunteerism on an extraordinary scale. Mary was at various times a founding member and first president of Playwrights' Horizons; president of the Mt. Sinai Auxiliary Board; and President of the West Side YWCA, an organization for which she went on to serve at a leadership level in both a national and global capacity, her travels on its behalf taking her around the world. A knowledgeable devotee of the arts, she was an enthusiastic subscriber of nearly every classical music institution and theater in town and, along with her late husband, Stephen, inculcated in her adoring son Matt a love of the arts that led to his career as a critic and journalist based in London.

Maggie was predeceased by her beloved husband of 45 years Richard I. and her adored sisters Constance H. Oliver O\'Neil and Audrey H. Hilliard. She is survived by her daughter Marguerite W. Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie\'s energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20\'s she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women\'s Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie\'s life will be held at a later date.

Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie\'s energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20\'s she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women\'s Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie\'s life will be held at a later date.

Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie's energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20's she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women's Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie's life will be held at a later date.

Mary had an indefatigable and vibrant zest for life and fought her illness to the very end, dying as she had always wished at home. Born in Winnetka, Il on April 1, 1929 the youngest of four children of Morton and Elizabeth Cahn, Mary attended North Shore Country Day and Rockford College and upon graduation moved to New York City in 1951. Early jobs at Scribner's and The New York Historical Society and a stint in Democratic Party politics gave way to a commitment to volunteerism on an extraordinary scale. Mary was at various times a founding member and first president of Playwrights' Horizons; president of the Mt. Sinai Auxiliary Board; and President of the West Side YWCA, an organization for which she went on to serve at a leadership level in both a national and global capacity, her travels on its behalf taking her around the world. A knowledgeable devotee of the arts, she was an enthusiastic subscriber of nearly every classical music institution and theater in town and, along with her late husband, Stephen, inculcated in her adoring son Matt a love of the arts that led to his career as a critic and journalist based in London.

Maggie was predeceased by her beloved husband of 45 years Richard I. and her adored sisters Constance H. Oliver O\'Neil and Audrey H. Hilliard. She is survived by her daughter Marguerite W. Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie\'s energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20\'s she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women\'s Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie\'s life will be held at a later date.

Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie\'s energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20\'s she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women\'s Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie\'s life will be held at a later date.

Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie's energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20's she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women's Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie's life will be held at a later date.

Mary had an indefatigable and vibrant zest for life and fought her illness to the very end, dying as she had always wished at home. Born in Winnetka, Il on April 1, 1929 the youngest of four children of Morton and Elizabeth Cahn, Mary attended North Shore Country Day and Rockford College and upon graduation moved to New York City in 1951. Early jobs at Scribner's and The New York Historical Society and a stint in Democratic Party politics gave way to a commitment to volunteerism on an extraordinary scale. Mary was at various times a founding member and first president of Playwrights' Horizons; president of the Mt. Sinai Auxiliary Board; and President of the West Side YWCA, an organization for which she went on to serve at a leadership level in both a national and global capacity, her travels on its behalf taking her around the world. A knowledgeable devotee of the arts, she was an enthusiastic subscriber of nearly every classical music institution and theater in town and, along with her late husband, Stephen, inculcated in her adoring son Matt a love of the arts that led to his career as a critic and journalist based in London.

Maggie was predeceased by her beloved husband of 45 years Richard I. and her adored sisters Constance H. Oliver O\'Neil and Audrey H. Hilliard. She is survived by her daughter Marguerite W. Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie\'s energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20\'s she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women\'s Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie\'s life will be held at a later date.
